# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Title of project

Tic-Tac-Toe React Exercise

## Description of project

This is a course project that is intended to practice using React to create a game. The game involves a parent component (Board) and a child component (Square) and the communication between them via props and callback functions.

## How to run

"Player 1" goes first: click any of the nine squares and mark the square with an "X."
Then "Player 0" goes: click any of the eight unoccupied squares and mark the square with an "O." If a player tries to click on an already occupied square, they will receive an alert.
Each player gets their own color (orange for Player 1 and pink for Player 0).
Whoever gets three in a row/column/diagonal wins.

## Roadmap of future improvements

Currently you can still continue the game even if someone wins. Going forward we could add a function to stop the game and provide a button to refresh the game.
